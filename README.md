# Image-Processing-Using-Python
Image Processing using Python applies computational methods to enhance, transform, and analyze images or video frames. With libraries like OpenCV, Pillow, NumPy, and scikit-image, tasks such as filtering, resizing, segmentation, and edge detection become easier, enabling applications in medical imaging, robotics, OCR, and computer vision.
